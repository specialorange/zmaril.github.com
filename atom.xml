    <id>http://zmaril.github.com/blog/2012/12/27/Why-I-dont-have-a-Facebook</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the past past three years, I&#8217;ve lived in Chicago (IL), College
Station (TX), Urbana (IL), Cincinnati (OH), and Mountain View (CA).
I&#8217;ve spent at least three months in each place and gotten to know and
love a good number of people from all over. I have friends who travel
internationally, and friends from school who are now scattered all
over the world. All of this movement and change brings up the topic of
keeping in touch fairly often. The main method for keeping in touch
now seems to be adding each other on Facebook and letting
conversations happen &#8220;naturally&#8221;. This poses an awkward problem for me
in that that <strong>I don&#8217;t have a Facebook account</strong> and <strong>I don&#8217;t want to
create one</strong>.</p>

<p>I got rid of my old Facebook account at the end of high school because
it had become a boring waste of time and I didn&#8217;t have any good reason
to keep it around much longer. This would probably still be the case
now, but my reasons for not having an account have evolved and gotten
much stronger as I&#8217;ve learned more about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">natural language processing</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">computer vision</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning</a>, and how some <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2&amp;hp&amp;">companies</a> make
<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21556263">money</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll premise this all with the one really strong assumption I&#8217;ve made:
<strong>I don&#8217;t think Facebook can make enough money from advertising to
satisfy shareholders or even hit internal monetization targets</strong>. While
there is <a href="ipo">very little that shareholders can do to influence</a>
Facebook&#8217;s decisions, everything could change very quickly in the near
future:</p>

<ul>
<li>Facebook hits a rough patch and has to sell more preferred stock to
finance operations.</li>
<li>Zuckerburg needs vast quantities of cash to buy Brazil as his summer get away.</li>
<li>Facebook uses &#8220;pressure&#8221; from shareholders as a valid reason to do
whatever it wants.</li>
<li>Zuckerburg dies/retires suddenly and somebody with a different vision for
Facebook becomes CEO.</li>
</ul>


<p>In my mind, there is a nonzero chance of Facebook needing to find a
way to make way more money than advertising will allow them to in the
next few years. And so, with that assumption, let&#8217;s put our
entrepreneur hats on and think: <strong>What can Facebook do to make money
besides ads?</strong> This exercise by itself is a fun challenge in trying to
figure out what resources Facebook has at its disposal. Maybe try
taking a few minutes and see what you can think up.</p>

<p>The most realistic option that I see happening is that Facebook takes
all that talent they&#8217;ve gathered from Stanford and other nerd farms to
mine all the data that they&#8217;ve accumulated. <strong>For the typical user,
they probably have a few years worth of status updates, wall posts,
messages, facebook relationships between members, events attended,
likes, location data based off of geo-tagged status updates and
reverse IP addresses, history of web sites visited
(<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-how-facebook-is-tracking-your-internet-activity-2012-9?op=1">collected from like counters on pages</a>)
and countless tagged photos</strong>. There is probably more that they know,
but all this should be enough to get us started down the path of
understanding why Facebook knows more about you than you ever will.</p>

<p>You there! Yes, you! Step right up and play <strong>&#8220;What could Facebook
possibly know about a user?&#8221;</strong></p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>$100 says that Facebook has figured out how to measure and monitor womens&#8217; Menstrual cycle based solely on their status updates.</p>&mdash; Zack Maril (@ZackMaril) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZackMaril/status/284115670814314496" data-datetime="2012-12-27T01:57:09+00:00">December 27, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://zmaril.github.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>If you are a woman, then you probably know the pains of the menstrual
cycle. I don&#8217;t have firsthand experience personally but I&#8217;ve heard
through the grapevine that it sucks. <strong>Have you ever seen a woman post a
status update like &#8220;Omg, I hate my body, does anybody have any
chocolate&#8221;?</strong> It is reasonable to assume that the user was on their
period when that update was made.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how Facebook could use status updates like this one and other
ones to calculate when a woman was on her menstrual cycle.
Specifically, what they would be looking for would be the length and
offset of the cycle (when does the cycle start and how long does it
last?). They could construct a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model">bag of words</a> model
based on the set of words like
&#8220;period&#8221;,&#8221;blood&#8221;,&#8221;midol&#8221;,&#8221;tampon&#8221;,&#8221;hurts&#8221;, etc. They could then create
a function that takes in a status update and uses the presence of the
words in the bag to give the most probably stage of her menstrual
cycle that a woman was on when she made that status update. Then, they
could run that function across every status update that a woman has
made and get back a time series giving the stages of a woman&#8217;s cycle.
From there, a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation">measure of autocorrelation</a>
could be applied to find out the length of the cycle. The offset could
then be found shortly afterwards through some straightforward methods.</p>

<p>This is a simple model of course and only works if a woman posts
somewhat directly about her period. But bag of words can be extremely
versatile; the model could be refined to figure out what words like
&#8220;chocolate&#8221;, &#8220;stay home&#8221;, &#8220;uggghhhhhhhh&#8221;, &#8220;boyssssss&#8221; and others would mean.
Instead of each status update considered individually, all the status
updates for one day could be lumped together which, I believe, would
help reduce noise in the data and give more precise results in terms
of confidence with less precision in time. There are many ways to
refine this model without much hassle.</p>

<p>If a user is sending messages about &#8220;blacking out&#8221; or asking &#8220;what
happened last night&#8221; then they might have an alcohol problem. Using
computer vision, you could count the number of
<a href="http://www.veerina.com/2012/Classyfying-Red-Cups.html">red cups that appear in photos</a>
that a user is tagged in. The more cups there are in a user&#8217;s photos,
the more likely a user might have a problem. <strong>Take the number of
occurances of certain words and the number of red cups, run it through
one of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Classification_algorithms">the dozens of classification algorithms</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_set">with a training set</a>, and you have a system that can
predict the chance that a user has alcoholism based on their profile</strong>.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>$100 says that Facebook knows approximately how many sexual partners you&#8217;ve had and tailors their ads based on that number.</p>&mdash; Zack Maril (@ZackMaril) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZackMaril/status/284117064799617024" data-datetime="2012-12-27T02:02:41+00:00">December 27, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://zmaril.github.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Have you been looking at somebody&#8217;s profile a ton lately? Have they
been looking at yours? Do you attend the same events as them? Have you
been sending a bunch of messages back and forth lately with someone?
<strong>Do any of your messages contain something along the lines of &#8220;Last
night was amazing ;)&#8221;?</strong> All of that information can be used to
predict whether two people have had sex. Using that same method on
every person a user has interacted with and you have the expected
value of the number of sexual partners and information with which you
can construct sexual orientation.</p>

<script async src="http://zmaril.github.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Checking the phone less often from the gym? Checking into Facebook
late at night, disrupting your sleep schedule? Status updates about
how stressed out you are? In a week or two, you will probably be sick
and Facebook will have known about it before you even had the first
symptom.</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>$100 says that Facebook can predict, with a 95% confidence interval of 5 years, when you will die and how.</p>&mdash; Zack Maril (@ZackMaril) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZackMaril/status/284119586666864640" data-datetime="2012-12-27T02:12:42+00:00">December 27, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://zmaril.github.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Facebook has all of the information needed to construct a highly
accurate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_table">life table</a>. They
know everything about the lives of roughly a billion people across the
globe. They have systems in place for finding out when a person is
dead and can use that information to start constructing massive life
tables based on user&#8217;s age, location, gender, sexual orientation, what
they liked on facebook, and who they were friends with. While it might
be a stretch to say that Facebook can predict cause of death, time of
death is well within the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>So. <strong>Facebook probably knows more about your life than you ever will
know.</strong>  Why does that matter?</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>$100 says that Facebook will be selling all of the information above and more to insurance companies within 5 years.</p>&mdash; Zack Maril (@ZackMaril) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZackMaril/status/284120780323827712" data-datetime="2012-12-27T02:17:27+00:00">December 27, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://zmaril.github.com//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Facebook needs to make money. Under the stated assumption, advertising
isn&#8217;t going to cut it. <strong> My main fear is that Facebook would soon be selling
information about me that even I don&#8217;t know.</strong></p>

<p>Who would want to buy detailed information about you, you ask?</p>

<ul>
<li>College admissions: How often does this person study, are
their parents wealthy?</li>
<li>Insurance companies: What are the health risks of insuring this
person, does this person&#8217;s family have a history of depression,
how often do users who like &#8216;Texting at Red Lights&#8217; get into car
accidents, what is the chance that this user will get an STD in
the future?</li>
<li>Employers: Does this person complain about work often, Does this
person work late at night, does this person have friends who we
can recruit later, has this person ever slept with someone from
work?</li>
<li>Identity thieves: Soooooo, how much do I need to pay to know <strong>everything</strong>
about a person?</li>
<li>Banks: What is the credit score for people who like &#8216;Student
loans suck&#8217;, what is the credit score for user based on who his
friends are?</li>
<li>The IRS: What is the difference between how much this person
 reported on their taxes and users like this person?</li>
<li>Oppressive governments: Where is this user, who are this user&#8217;s
friends and families?</li>
</ul>


<p>So, I think it will soon be in Facebook&#8217;s best interest to start
selling users&#8217; information to parties who will use this information in
ways that are not in users&#8217; best interest. Your life will be moving
more towards a completely asymmetrical model of knowledge: parties who
you don&#8217;t know exist will know more about your life than you do. As
soon as companies figure out they can use this information to their
advantage, they will throw as many resources at it as they can. I can
imagine far more negative consequences of greater magnitude of this
knowledge difference than I can of positive consequences. Bluntly, <strong>I
think you are fucked if you have a Facebook account</strong>.</p>

<p><strong> Bonus </strong></p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>$100 says that if Facebook thought you would click on more ads when you were single, it would try to ruin your marriage or relationship.</p>&mdash; Zack Maril (@ZackMaril) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZackMaril/status/284121414401933312" data-datetime="2012-12-27T02:19:58+00:00">December 27, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>If this were implemented at Facebook, whoever did it will probably
take that secret to her gold-lined grave. Facebook would probably have him
killed if she tried to talk. (I&#8217;m only half joking about Zuck having
someone killed).</p>

<hr />

<p><strong> Double Bounus </strong></p>

<p>You might be able to delete your profile (<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Permanently-Delete-a-Facebook-Account">it takes two weeks</a>), but there is no
way you can get Facebook to throw out your data. If you want to mess
up their systems, you really only have one option that I can think of:
start throwing in random noise into your profile for a few weeks or
months before you wipe your profile and then delete it. Tag yourself
in pictures as people who you obviously are not. Change your birthday
often. Like things that you don&#8217;t like. Message people you wouldn&#8217;t
normally message. Defriend a ton of people and add in some random
people of various types (local and global). Change your name. Do
whatever you can think of that you wouldn&#8217;t normally do.</p>

<p>And then at the very end of it all, remove all of your information
from Facebook. Some crazy unicode name, no friends, no pictures, no
likes, all of your settings changed to strictest privacy possible.
They will have a record of everything you did, but they will have to
be very, very careful about how they use your data from now on. If an
intern messes up and only uses dead profiles as they last appeared,
then you will be a ghost. If an engineer messes up and doesn&#8217;t account
for the random noise at the end, then your profile will be worthless
to them. Beyond that, that is really all you can do. They already know
everything about you; all you can do is help them make mistakes.</p>

    <link href="http://zmaril.github.com/blog/2012/07/10/ideas-about-future-of-d3/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-10T23:31:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://zmaril.github.com/blog/2012/07/10/ideas-about-future-of-d3</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been working with <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3.js</a> a good deal. I&#8217;ve created
several <a href="https://github.com/zmaril/d3.js-boilerplate">open source</a> <a href="https://github.com/zmaril/d3-bootstrap-plugins">d3.js projects</a>,
participated in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!searchin/d3-js/zack$20maril">d3.js mailing list</a>, and
<a href="https://www.odesk.com/blog/2012/07/visualizations-of-odesk-oconomy/">successfully released</a> a rather large
<a href="http://research.odesk.com/visualizations/country-dashboard/">d3.js project</a>. I have at least as much perspective as a
self taught college kid can have at this point. Here are some ideas
that I&#8217;ve had about moving d3.js and related technologies
forward. They&#8217;ve been broken into the more general ideas first and the
backbone related ideas last. My hope is that this will cause one of
three things to happen:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ll get motivated and make some of this happen.</li>
<li>Somebody else will get motivated and make some of this happen.</li>
<li>Somebody will point out that these things have been done and
everyone can be lazy.</li>
</ul>


<h1>General Ideas</h1>

<h2>Encourage and use coffeescript</h2>

<p>The function syntax, fat arrow, and object creation sugar are the
features that saved me the most time in aggregate. With d3.js you are
writing a lot of functions that are just object property retrievers,
so the terse syntax comes in handy (<code>(ob)-&gt; ob.x</code>). Debugging is a
slight pain in that line numbers don&#8217;t typically match up. For me, it
has been a net win. As I get better with coffeescript and d3.js,
debugging time will hopefully go down while I learn more useful
features.</p>

<h2>Use grunt</h2>

<p><a href="http://ireneros.com/">Irene Ros</a> pointed out
<a href="https://github.com/cowboy/grunt">grunt</a> to me and it was love at
first sight. I&#8217;ve been using it with the
<a href="https://github.com/zmaril/d3-bootstrap-plugins">d3-bootstrap-plugin</a>
project and it has
<a href="https://github.com/zmaril/d3-bootstrap-plugins">helped immensely</a>
with development. It&#8217;s really amazing how freeing <code>grunt</code> and <code>grunt
build</code> can be. I am looking to learn more about the system. If I could
automatically run <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code> when I do <code>grunt
watch</code>, I would be way happy. I&#8217;ll try and do a post on using grunt
and d3, but it isn&#8217;t too hard to <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/meeting-grunt-the-build-tool-for-javascript/">figure out in an afternoon</a>.</p>

<h2>Testing visualizations with saved images</h2>

<p>A problem I&#8217;ve had is that I really want to start writing tests for my
visualizations. They have started to get sufficiently complex in some
cases and things have broken down for several hours/days before I was
able to notice them again. Stressful.There aren&#8217;t too many solutions
to this that I know of. You can test the DOM pretty easily with the
various testing libraries out there. But that&#8217;s almost a direct test
of d3.js itself in most cases. Not incredibly useful given that d3.js
already has
<a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/tree/master/test">pretty good test coverage</a>.</p>

<p>A possible solution for this is to create a collection of saved images
that represent what the visualization should look like. You could pair
<a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">the selenium webdriver</a> with a framework like
<a href="http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit">qunit</a> or
<a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">jasmine</a> to create a image driven
test suite. You would have a program that walks you through the tests
one by one, displays the image, and asks &#8220;Is this what you expected?&#8221;
It then saves all of the reference images. Each time you run the
tests, it would go back through and recapture all of the pictures. A
test would fail if the picture wasn&#8217;t within a set threshold for
deviation of pixels. You could get really fancy with this and take
snapshots of images as things get interacted with randomly, as well as
have UI exploration based on the state of the javascript
environment (Clojure/script would probably be a pretty good tool for
this sort of thing). The main point is that I want to write tests that
use saved images as the method for evaluating whether or not the test
passes. No speculation on difficulty, prior art, implementation, and
performance from me at this point. I currently don&#8217;t have plans to do
anything related to this.</p>

<h1>Combining d3.js and backbone</h1>

<p>Let&#8217;s get some context for the upcoming ideas. From what I can tell,
the two major frameworks for d3.js right now are
<a href="http://nvd3.com/">nvd3</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/michael/dance">dance.js</a>.</p>

<p>nvd3 is a general charting library that has gotten a fair bit of press
lately. I watch it on github and I&#8217;ve seen a marked increase in terms
of rate of commits and issues added to the project day after
day. People are excited about the idea of a general framework with
d3. nvd3 is a good idea with a smart/motivated developer behind it and
could end up displacing highcharts.</p>

<p>dance.js is a project that I have admired from afar at this point. I
view it as one of those projects that is fun and will teach the
developer a ton. It might not ever end up use in production, but it
doesn&#8217;t matter. The developer will write better code all around
because of it. Really, go take a look a look at it. It&#8217;s fun to read
through and think about the abstractions that are being created. It&#8217;s
got some obscure libraries as dependencies and purposefully
reimplements half of backbone.</p>

<p>So, as far as I know, that is the current state of the major open source d3
frameworks. There is
<a href="https://github.com/shutterstock/rickshaw">Rickshaw</a> for time series,
but it isn&#8217;t
<a href="https://github.com/shutterstock/rickshaw/commits/master">actively being developed further beyond maintenance</a>
as far as I can tell. There has been some excellent talk about
<a href="http://corner.squareup.com/2012/04/building-analytics.html">combining ember.js and d3</a>,
but not much open source has come out of it. This is the most active
<a href="http://cmeiklejohn.github.com/ember-visualizations/">ember+d3</a> work
I&#8217;ve been able to find. As far as backbone and d3 goes, there is <a href="http://drsm79.github.com/Backbone-d3/">a
project</a> silently gathering
dust on github and <a href="https://github.com/jondot/graphene">graphene</a>,
which is <a href="https://github.com/jondot/graphene">semiactive</a>.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr Try to use nvd3 if you want free/pretty d3 charts now.</strong></p>

<p>(Note: As of December 2012, much of this information is no longer
correct. Rickshaw is getting love, ember and d3 are being combined
together well, and, well, open source is moving forward.)</p>

<h2>Eidetic backbone</h2>

<p>Moving towards new ideas, a month or so back, I noticed that backbone
and ember allowed you to manage the URL in neat ways with
<a href="http://backbonetutorials.com/what-is-a-router/">javascript based routers</a>. At
the time, backbone had better documentation about getting started, so
I choose backbone and got started using the routes to encode the state
of the interface of the oDesk country dashboard. This meant I could
link directly to the project bubbles of
<a href="http://research.odesk.com/visualizations/country-dashboard/#/bubble/Russia">Russia</a>
and
<a href="http://research.odesk.com/visualizations/country-dashboard/#/bubble/Canada">Canada</a>
with very little effort.  This was way cool and set me down the path
of thinking through how to combine backbone and d3.js to produce
excellent visualizations with very little developer effort.</p>

<p>The basic abstraction was encoding the state of an interface within
the URL. This allowed people to directly link to pieces of a
visualization as well as making the backbone much more useful (trying
messing around with the oDesk visualization and then hitting the back
button). I
<a href="https://github.com/johnjosephhorton/gg2d3/blob/master/country-dashboard/js/index.coffee">implemented this in a messy way</a>,
with a ton of calls to router.navigate littered throughout the
code. It got the job done.</p>

<p>Generalizing away from this, we can start thinking in terms of the
state of the interface. For the oDesk visualization, the state of the
interface depended on the section being displayed. For the
<a href="http://research.odesk.com/visualizations/country-dashboard/#/compare">compare section</a>,
we encoded the selected countries within the URL as well as whether
the top graph was being displayed in absolute or log scale. For the
<a href="http://research.odesk.com/visualizations/country-dashboard/#/watch/false/42">watch section</a>,
we encoded the hour being displayed as well as whether we are using a
relative or absolute scale. The
<a href="http://research.odesk.com/visualizations/country-dashboard/#/bubble">bubble section</a>
recorded only the country within the URL. If you crawl through the
github repo hard enough, you can probably find all the instances
across the multiple files where I reference variables like
selectedCountries and what not.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I wish I could have written (in coffeescript):</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='coffeescript'>CompareState = Backbone.Model
    countries: [&quot;India&quot;,&quot;Denial&quot;,&quot;`Murica&quot;]
    log: true

WatchState = Backbone.Model
    time: 42
    log: true

BubbleState = Backbone.Model
    country: &quot;Canananada&quot;

Eidetic.Router.extend
    routes:
        compare:
            model: CompareState
        
            toUrl: ()-&gt;
                countries = encodeURI(@countries.join[&quot;/&quot;])
                &quot;/#{@log}/#{countries}&quot;
                
            fromURL: (url)-&gt;
               sections = url.split('/')
               log = sections[0] is &quot;true&quot;
               countries = (decodeURI(c) for c in sections[1..])
               @model.set
                   log: log
                   countries: countries
                   
            callback: &quot;compare&quot;

        watch:
            model: WatchState
        
            toUrl: ()-&gt; &quot;/#{@attributes.log}/#{@attributes.time}&quot;
                
            fromURL: (url)-&gt;
               sections = url.split('/')
               log = sections[0] is &quot;true&quot;
               time = +sections[1]
               @model.set
                   log: log
                   time: time
                   
           callback: &quot;watch&quot;

        bubble:
            model: BubbleState
        
            toUrl: (model)-&gt; &quot;/#{model.country}&quot;
                
            fromURL: (url)-&gt;
               @model.set
                   country: url.replace('/',&quot;&quot;)
                   
            callback: &quot;watch&quot;

    compare: ()-&gt; #display compare html. No updating of url's here.
        compareView.update()
    watch: ()-&gt; #display watch html. No updating of url's here either.
        watchView.update()
    bubble: ()-&gt; #You know what is up by now.
        bubbleView.update()</code></pre>
</div>


<p>What would ideally happen is that the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory">Eidetic</a> router would
hook up the model such that whenever the model changed the router
would change as well. In addition, the Eidetic router would take the
inbound url and set up the State model correctly. The design behind
the API is still pretty rough honestly. I&#8217;ve spent most of my time so
far just playing around with how to structure this idea of storing the
state of the interface within the URL. I have a
<a href="https://github.com/zmaril/Eidetic">repo set up for development</a>, but
only within the past few days have I gotten an idea about where to
take the design of the API. I suspect within the next month I will
have something usable up there.</p>

<p>Why does this matter for d3.js though? This would be developed purely
as an extension of backbone. As I got better with d3.js, my sights
start to soar. I wanted to create the next big dashboard. And
&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if state crossed over between those two charts?
Woah! That&#8217;s awesome! Let&#8217;s do it again! Three charts! Four charts and
legend! Wait. Why is it broken? Where is my state?&#8221;  It&#8217;s part of
solution to the puzzle of managing a complex interface that has
multiple interactive and connected charts.</p>

<p>I want to put all of my important state in one place and I want the
URL to denote and remember the state of the interface. I don&#8217;t want to
have to design a complex framework each time I set out to design a
complex dashboard. backbone would handle the state abstractions and d3
handles the svg. The Eidetic router is not a hard hack to do, but I
really want to nail the API design from the get go. Looking at it now,
I will probably move the callbacks straight into the route
definition. Maybe.</p>

<h2>d3.js charts as backbone views</h2>

<p>Now that we have gotten into the spirit of thinking with backbone,
let&#8217;s start thinking about collections and reusable charts. Here&#8217;s an
example of what I mean:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='coffeescript'>Book = Backbone.Model

Books = Backbone.Collection.extend
    model: Book

Books.add({pages: Math.round(Math.random()*250)} for i in [0..100])

Histogram = Backbone.view.extend
    initialize: ()-&gt;
        @svg = {}
        @svg.svg = d3.select(@el).apppend(&quot;svg&quot;)
            .attr(&quot;height&quot;,@options.height)
            .attr(&quot;width&quot;,@options.width)
            .classed(&quot;histogram&quot;)
            
        @svg.bars = @svg.svg.append(&quot;g&quot;).attr(&quot;id&quot;,&quot;bars&quot;)
        @svg.axis = @svg.svg.append(&quot;g&quot;).attr(&quot;id&quot;,&quot;axis&quot;)

        @d3 = {}
        @d3.hist =  d3.layout.histogram()
            .value(@options.value)

    render: ()-&gt;
        bins = @d3.hist(@collection)
        #Make all of this actually work
        @d3.x = d3.scale().range
        @svg.bars.selectAll(&quot;rect&quot;).data(bins).enter()
            .append(&quot;rect&quot;)
            .scale
        #If I wasn't lazy, code for the axis would be here

    remove: ()-&gt; 
        @svg.svg.remove()

BooksHistogram = Histogram
    collection: Books
    element: document.getElementById(&quot;#booksHistogram&quot;)
    value: (d)-&gt; d.get(&quot;pages&quot;)
    height: 200
    width: 200</code></pre>
</div>


<p>And bam! You have a histogram of the books! That updates dynamically
as your backbone data does! And the implementation is reusable for other
models. This is what I see coming from combining backbone and d3
together.</p>

<p>That is most of what I was thinking about while working on the oDesk project.</p>
